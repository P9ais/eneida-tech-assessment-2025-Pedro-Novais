//The bug in this code is in the uint8_t initialization, because if it's uint8 it can't use 
//values above 255. And it's doing an if with i counting from 250 to 1050, which is not possible.
//To fix this, we can change uint8_t to uint16_t or uint32_t, which can handle larger values.   
//A standard gcc compiler won't compile this
